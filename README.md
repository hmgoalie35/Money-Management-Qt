# Money-Management-Qt

A program that models a bank account register and makes it easier to keep track of bank deposits and withdrawals

I had originally wrote this same program in python and java, but decided to port it over to Qt/C++ in order to learn Qt.

This was a fun side project I worked on in my spare time
